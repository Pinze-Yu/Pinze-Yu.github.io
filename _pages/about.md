I am a senior undergraduate student from [Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences]((https://cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/)), [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/). My research interest includes model interpretability in computer vision and natural language processing. Previously, I have explored some theoretical problems in numerical computing.
